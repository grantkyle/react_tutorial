This project is my first ever attempt at React. It may be worth noting that I am currently more than 4 months into a 6 month coding bootcamp. We started with front end, moved to the back end and are slowly coming back to the front end. We have yet to learn React (even though we are about to focus the remaining six weeks of bootcamp to React) but 

I wanted to get ahead by starting to learn this complex, easy to use framework, and am excited for the endless possibilities of what I can do with it!!!# react_todo_heroku
